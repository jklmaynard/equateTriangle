EQUATE TRIANGLE
A jQuery JavaScript app.

A simple JS application that equates the sides of a triangle and determines whether or not the triangle is equilateral, scalene, or isosceles; or, if it is not a triangle, the application will say so with a picture of a scornful Sean Connery.

The equation is neat and pretty, I think.  Easy logic, although it could be more pared down, perhaps.
